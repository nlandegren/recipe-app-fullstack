# recipe-app-fullstack

This project is the result of a course in web development backend, which was one of the courses in my two-year programme in .NET development. This was an assignment in which I was supposed to leverage most of what I had learnt in previous courses, including programming in C#, building databases with T-SQL, modeling databases with Entity Framework Core, and basic frontend web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The app is implemented in ASP.NET Core using Razor pages. With the app I included an API that gives access to a subset of the database.
